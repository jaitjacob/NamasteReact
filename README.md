# 🔬 NamasteReact

Welcome. This repo contains code &amp; learnings from Namaste React bootcamp that I am attending.

This bootcamp dives deeply into the internal workings of React as a library. So a lot of React concepts will be demystified here.

# 🌏 How to navigate?

Each Chapter folder has **two** folders within. Namely,

`code` :point_right: contains practice code related to concepts taught in that Chapter.

`recap` :point_right: contains recap of what was taught in a PDF form. this is something I create for my own purposes occassionally posting it in our Discord.

# 💫 Highlights

_We are only 3 weeks into the bootcamp. Yet to add this. I will use this space to add projects that we build and things I am proud of from the bootcamp._
