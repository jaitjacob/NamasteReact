In this chapter I'm experimenting with Functional Components.

# 🥡 Takeaways

1.  Use JSX

    🛡️ It is safe to embed user input in JSX.

    > **Note**
    > By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything that’s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent XSS (cross-site-scripting) attacks.

2.  Read about how Babel converts JSX to JavaScript.

    - Read about Abstract Syntax Tree.

3.  Use Babel.
    - Nothing to do here because Parcel comes with Babel out-of-box.
